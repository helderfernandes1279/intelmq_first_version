This bot was developed to filter events with a JSON rule file


The file must have a JSON array structure, the array contains a set of rules to match against the events.


Example:


[ 
  {
    "feed" : "openbl",
    "source_cymru_cc" : "PT"
  }, 
    {
    "feed" : "openbl",
    "source_cymru_cc" : "BR"
  }
]
